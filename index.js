// IS JOHNNY MAKING PROGRESS?

// To train for an upcoming marathon, Johnny goes on long runs each Saturday.
// He tracks the kilometers he runs each Saturday.
// If the distance run one Saturday exceeds the distance run the previous
// Saturday, he calls that a "progress day".

// Create a function that takes an array of the amount of kilometers Johnny ran on
// different Saturdays within a certain period, and returns Johnny's total number
// of progress days from that period.

// Examples:
// progressDays([4, 4, 3, 4]) --> 1
// progressDays([10, 11, 12, 9, 10]) --> 3
// progressDays([6, 5, 3, 4]) --> 1
// progressDays([9, 9]) --> 0

progressDays = (runs) => {
  let progressDays = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < runs.length; i++) {
    if (runs[i+1] && (runs[i] < runs[i+1])) {
      progressDays +=1}
  }

  return progressDays;
};
